## Code Structure
- **Main Game Panel**: Divided into sections to display the game grid, player options, and scores.
- **AI Logic**: Built into the `Start()` method, with difficulty modes that affect the AIâ€™s move decision-making.
- **Event Handling**: Button clicks are managed with an `ActionListener`, responding to grid cell clicks, game reset, and quitting.
